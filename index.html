            <p>"BPO" stands for Business Process Outsourcing. It refers to the <br> practice of contracting specific business tasks or processes to <br> a third-party service provider. These tasks can range from customer <br> support and technical assistance to back-office functions like data entry,<br> accounting, human resources, and more.</p>
